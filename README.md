# Isolation forest for time series
This notebook is based on this great article:  https://techrando.com/2019/08/23/unsupervised-machine-learning-approaches-for-outlier-detection-in-time-series/  
and it's meant to confirm an hyphotesis: that the isolation forest's results can be easily improved by adding local information to each datapoint.
